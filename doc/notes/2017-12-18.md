;; `'` is 'literal', so `'foo` is akin to a symbol
;; `[` is a literal list
;; `(` is 'grouping', but not a list (nestable, but not nesting)
;;   it is used for hinting the parser and readability by humans
;;   meat-parsers and cyber-parsers
;; `,` is an optional separator
;; unquoted symbols are intended to be replaced with the values
;;   bound to their names
;; `@` is function invocation
