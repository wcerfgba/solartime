## since adding tests

we now have minimal testing working with a module, maths, containing a single 
'app' file. 


### 3. module integration

the first module is too minimal to build a unit suitable for deployment as an 
app, we need to package the app code from this module into the final app in 
order to consider the build complete.

```
src/
  web.target/
    template/
      index.html
      app.js
    test/
      ???
  maths.dsl/
    maths.js
    maths.ohm
  drawing.module/
    circle.maths
    test/
      transpile.spec.js
```

```
$ run-js tool/build.js src/web.target
```

```
build/
  web/
    index.html
    app.js
```
