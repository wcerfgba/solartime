## roadmap

### 1. initial demonstration

1. `maths/app/circle.maths`
2. `maths/dsl/maths.ohm`
3. `maths/dsl/maths.js`

we begin by writing the app code. we allow ourselves to co-develop the code for 
the particular problem we wish to solve, and the language in which we implement 
that solutions: the computer is a blank canvas, and we develop a dsl for each 
separate chunk of code.

once we have sketched the solution (the 'app' code), we need to formalise the 
dsl we have assumed when we wrote the solution. we represent the syntax first, 
using an [Ohm](https://github.com/harc/ohm) grammar.

finally, we connect the dsl syntax to equivalent syntax in a target language 
by using Ohm's semantics system to decorate the parse tree with strings 
representing JavaScript code.


### 2. adding tests

1. `tool/transpile.js`
2. `tool/test.js`

`transpile.js` will contain the boilerplate needed around the Ohm action 
dictionary in `<component>/dsl/<dsl-lang>.<target-lang>`, allowing us to specify
just the dictionary, which can be used to transpile an arbitrary file.

`test.js` walks `src/` looking for app/dsl/test tuples and transpiles app code 
from the dsl to each target, and compares the output with the expectation 
fixture.
